I am building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser.

I've used the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
